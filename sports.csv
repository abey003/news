"Baker Mayfield: Mike Evans’s 1,000-yard streak important, but he cares about winning - NBC Sports",https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c11d9c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2822x1587+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb3%2F06%2Fc257a708420d889709a33ecf98e4%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2180570247,"Wide receiver Mike Evans is back on the practice field and moving closer to returning to the Buccaneers lineup after missing three games and most of a fourth with a hamstring injury. It also opens up the door for Evans to make a run at his 11th straight season with 1,000 receiving yards. Evans has 335 yards, so he’d need to average 95 yards per game to reach the milestone and Mayfield said that it will be on everyone’s mind without being their main focal point. “You guys have been around Mike for long enough now,” Mayfield said, via the team’s website. “The streak, yeah, it’s important to us, but he cares about winning."

Hanewicz has long been one of the stadium project’s most vocal critics, and she voted against it. Muhammad — who served a partial term after his predecessor stepped down and opted not to run for election this year — voted against the deal. It wasn’t clear Wednesday whether Muhammad planned on attending Thursday’s meeting: He was scheduled to speak at the opening of a new food bank in Jordan Park at the same time Thursday afternoon, according to an event announcement. He didn’t immediately return a phone call and text message seeking comment Wednesday."
Why losing Melton deals massive blow to Warriors' hopes - NBC Sports Bay Area,https://media.nbcsportsbayarea.com/2024/10/DeAnthony-Melton-Getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,"“I feel so bad for De’Anthony,” Kerr said Wednesday, two hours before tipoff against the Atlanta Hawks. “He’s such a perfect fit for us and we were so excited to have him. “BP is another good option, and might end up there, depending on how things go,” Kerr said. “But BP could fit in that role well, too.” Make no mistake, though, this is an absolute Plan B move out of necessity. The Warriors now must seek new combinations that can deliver what they anticipated before Melton went down."

Arlington: No structural issues at AT&T Stadium - NBC Sports,https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/18ea89b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4624x2601+0+241/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa7%2F62%2Ff3c21b6649aab84ea0cd8f9b1deb%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2185478271,"Via ESPN.com, City of Arlington communications coordinator Susan Schrock has since said that the venue is fine. “Our building inspector and our deputy fire marshal did talk to AT&T Stadium crews today and determined that there weren’t any structural issues with the venue or the roof,” Schrock said. There might be other design flaws that haven’t become obvious yet because there hasn’t been a gust of wind, or an equivalent trigger, to expose it. It should mandate a full review of the building to ensure that no other problems are lurking. If they don’t — and if there’s a future incident that gets someone injured or worse — the fact that a top-to-bottom review wasn’t done after Monday’s incident will become evidence of failure to ensure that the building is safe for employees and customers to enter."

That list of 50 included Seattle Seahawks legends Marshawn Lynch, Shaun Alexander, Ricky Watters, Earl Thomas, and Kam Chancellor. Earl Thomas, of course, most famously known for his pivotal role in the Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl-era smash-mouth defensive hit-squad ‘Legion of Boom,’ finished his NFL career as a six-time Pro Bowler and three-time first-team All-Pro. Watters signed on with the Eagles in 1995 as a free agent and rushed for over 1,000 yards all three seasons he was there. Along with Earl Thomas, the first-ballot semifinalists also include Eli Manning, Luke Kuechly, Terrell Suggs, Adam Vinatieri, and Marshal Yanda."

Woody would not have wanted his fingerprints on the move to bench Rodgers. He’ll next be talking on Tuesday to Pat McAfee and Wednesday at his press conference. Whatever he says — and does — about this will be very significant. And it could be that those who have mobilized to push the “Woody was joking” message are playing to an audience of one."
