"Star Wars Outlaws finally getting rid of forced stealth from ""almost all quest objectives"" - Eurogamer",https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Kay-Vess-looks-around-a-crate-she-is-hiding-behind-in-Star-Wars-Outlaws.jpg?width=1200&height=630&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp,"For most people, though, this change means Kay and Nixx will now transition into combat after getting caught while sneaking, rather than getting ported back to the last checkpoint and being made to start the section again. As someone who got so frustrated with one particular stealth quest section she gave up on the game altogether, this is great news. We awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars on its initial release in August.

Samsung warns us to be careful when sending RCS messages to iPhones - Android Police,https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/google-messages-rcs-hero-16-9-ap24.jpg,"It took seemingly forever, but we can finally hold RCS chats with our iPhone-smitten friends and family. The press note released by Samsung reiterates most of what we know about RCS. This really is not that surprising, considering Apple has done the bare minimum to implement RCS into iMessage. RCS chats with their Android friends, the fact that these messages are not encrypted remains a significant drawback.

"On launch day, STALKER 2 is flying up the Steam charts as Microsoft Flight Simulator nosedives - Windows Central",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tTtz8eHkSTpNktgGkaQu5W-1200-80.jpg,"The follow-up to Microsoft and Asobo Studio's hit 2020 sim garnered quite a bit of hype before its release on Tuesday, but quickly nosedived post-launch as players couldn't (and still can't) get into the game or play it for long without freezes or crashes. As someone who's been playing the STALKER games for many years now, it's awesome to see STALKER 2 performing so well, especially knowing the working conditions that GSC Game World has had to contend with amid Russia's ongoing war of aggression. On the flip side of things, there's Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, which has proven to be a huge disappointment so far. It's one of the most captivating open-world shooters I've ever played, and is a must-play if you have Xbox Game Pass. His favorite game of all time is probably NieR: Automata, though Elden Ring, Fallout: New Vegas, and Team Fortress 2 are in the running, too."
NASA wants SpaceX and Blue Origin to deliver cargo to the moon - The Verge,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVTDjHIUl0uggX35YEfx4ochK5U=/0x0:2412x1244/1200x628/filters:focal(1206x622:1207x623)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25745281/nasa_blue_origin_lander.png,"By  Emma Roth, a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. The agency wants Elon Musk’s SpaceX to use its Starship cargo lander to deliver a pressurized rover to the Moon “no earlier” than 2032, while Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin will be tasked with delivering a lunar surface habitat no sooner than 2033. Both companies are developing human landing systems for Artemis missions — SpaceX for Artemis III and Blue Origin for Artemis V. NASA later asked both companies to develop cargo-hauling variants of those landers, capable of carrying 26,000 to 33,000 pounds of equipment and other materials to the Moon. NASA says it will issue proposals to SpaceX and Blue Origin at the beginning of next year. “Having two lunar lander providers with different approaches for crew and cargo landing capability provides mission flexibility while ensuring a regular cadence of Moon landings for continued discovery and scientific opportunity,”  Stephen D. Creech, NASA’s assistant deputy associate administrator for the Moon to Mars program, said in the announcement."
You Might Want to Wait Until Next Year to Buy an iPhone - Lifehacker,https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01JD5J2M9WNW3TQ7RPEFVFDRBY/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.png,"You certainly have options: Apple's latest generation of smartphones, the iPhone 16 series, offers four different models, each with their own plusses and minuses. As reported by MacRumors, analysts have confirmed Apple is working on a fourth-generation iPhone SE. MacRumors says the SE could have a 6.1-inch OLED display with Face ID, an upgraded A-series chip (though it's not certain which chip Apple would use), USB-C, a 48 MP rear camera, 8GB of RAM, and this new 5G modem. Hopefully, scrapping these features most users don't want or need can motivate Apple to price the SE accordingly.

Billionaire Waits Outside Supermarket To Fight Call Of Duty Fan - Kotaku,"https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/7fdb0153a02750de1a5dcbea3a8ddde7.jpg","But not all of us have blamed the billionaire who owns our internet service provider, challenged him to a fight, and watched stunned, months later, as he actually showed up. Earlier this year, an X user who goes by JimmyBLLT and has a picture of Everton midfielder Iliman Ndiaye as their profile avatar got heated while playing Call of Duty (via Dexerto). “Xavier Niel je te déteste je te propose un 1v1 devant le Lidl de la rue Sainte à Marseille,” he tweeted back in May, which roughly translates to, “Xavier Niel I hate you, I propose a 1v1 in front of the Lidl on rue Sainte in Marseille.” That would have been that, just another lizard brain moment evaporating into the endless ether of the internet, except that Xavier Niel caught wind of the insult and decided to visit said Lidl—an Aldi-like discount supermarket—just blocks away from the Old Port of Marseille. The telecommunications tycoon is a majority shareholder in one of France’s largest internet providers, Iliad SA. “I’m waiting for you,” he wrote in a quote-tweet of the original post."

This latest build has little to offer in terms of new features or big changes. Just a few small new updates have been discovered: Overall, beta 3 is focused on performance improvements and bug fixes. Which makes sense, because we’re getting very close to Apple shipping the RC (release candidate) version of iOS 18.2. These include: But there are also great additions outside of AI, such as a redesigned Mail app, new Find My features, Camera Control upgrades, and even more."
Messenger video calls will look and sound better — and add AI backgrounds - The Verge,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/74R12JbpqFwMJrDuUmSXiVjOhRY=/0x0:1920x1188/1200x628/filters:focal(957x616:958x617)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25745137/02_HD_Video_Calls_Carousel_01_2.png,"By  Wes Davis, a weekend editor who covers the latest in tech and entertainment. Meta has announced that it’s adding HD video calling and noise suppression to its Messenger app, along with several other features like AI backgrounds that help bring it up to par with other popular smartphone video calling apps. You’ll also find options to adjust noise cancellation or switch your call’s audio output. Meta says it’s giving users the ability to leave voice or video messages as well. If you say something like “using Messenger” at the end when you ask Siri to make a call or send a text, and it should do so with Meta’s app instead of one of Apple’s built-in ones."

Discover Authority Insights for more exclusive reports, app teardowns, leaks, and in-depth tech coverage you won’t find anywhere else. We first spotted work on this Even Dimmer feature in one of the early preview builds of Android 15, but we originally weren’t sure how it would work. Even Dimmer should do the same thing as Extra Dim except it’s activated differently. This flag isn’t set in the device-specific framework overlay of any other Pixel device that we checked."
