Related article Largest known genome is within this plain plant on the forest floor, study says This technology, combined with powerful computing and artificial intelligence methods, allows researchers to create an ID card for each cell type. The cell atlas aims to fill in a missing link between genes, diseases and treatment therapies. “This landmark collection of papers from the international Human Cell Atlas community underscores the tremendous progress toward mapping every single kind of human cell and how they change as we grow up and age,” Farrar said in a statement."
"Intense Cold Exposure Might Actually Help You Sleep Better, Study Shows - Yahoo! Voices",https://media.zenfs.com/en/sciencealert_160/ea75e8ff48fe259afd86e22dc3e0ad1c,"While most of us won't be setting up a cryochamber at home, the research might lead to better treatments for those with sleep problems and help with chronic inflammation or early signs of dementia. ""Our sleep architecture analysis revealed a significant increase in the duration of slow-wave sleep during nights following cryostimulation compared to nights without cryostimulation,"" says kinesiologist Olivier Dupuy, from the University of Montreal in Canada. There are also many variables that can be altered, like time spent in the cryochamber. Existing evidence shows whole-body cryostimulation (WBC) can calm down the heart after exercise, reduce inflammation, and improve general well-being. ""The use of cold for therapeutic purposes goes back to ancient Greece,"" says Dupuy."
Fasting-Style Diet Seems to Result in Dynamic Changes in Human Brain - ScienceAlert,https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/ClockInsideBrainofPerson.jpg,"Scientists looking to tackle our ongoing obesity crisis have made an important discovery: Intermittent calorie restriction leads to significant changes both in the gut and the brain, which may open up new options for maintaining a healthy weight. Researchers from China studied 25 volunteers classed as obese over a period of 62 days, during which they took part in an intermittent energy restriction (IER) program – a regime that involves careful control of calorie intake and relative fasting on some days. What's more, the gut microbiome changes, analyzed via stool samples and blood measurements, were linked to particular brain regions. For example, the bacteria Coprococcus comes and Eubacterium hallii were negatively associated with activity in the left inferior frontal orbital gyrus, an area involved in executive function, including our willpower when it comes to food intake. An earlier version of this article was published in December 2023."

Here's the problem: ""Right now when a patient has sepsis we send samples for culture and that could take days to come back,"" said Monaghan. This research is a partnership between Rhode Island Hospital and the National Institutes of Health to pioneer this faster, lifesaving approach, identifying in particular those that have an infection resistant to certain antibiotics. Instead of a yes or no, on whether you have COVID,  he said this new digital test will give you 26,000 yes's and no's, honing in on a precise cause of sepsis. They've been collecting samples from previous patients who've agreed to take part in this research."
15 Warning Signs of Dementia You Shouldn’t Ignore - AARP,https://aarp.widen.net/content/uzwrppeuhz/jpeg/79227_dementia.jpeg?position=c&color=ffffffff&quality=80&u=7wu7cw,"Get Moving With Our Workout Series You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. Still, memory lapses can provoke anxiety for older adults who are often left wondering whether it’s all normal or a sign of something more serious. Results from a 2019 National Poll on Healthy Aging found that nearly half of respondents ages 50 to 64 are worried about developing dementia. Similarly, a 2021 survey from AARP found that nearly half of adults 40 and older think it’s likely they will get dementia. “Those more significant lapses” — especially when it comes to recent events — are concerning, says Judith Heidebrink, M.D., a neurologist and clinical professor at University of Michigan Health."

"Eliminate Clozapine REMS, FDA Panels Say - Medscape",https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/dt_210702_fda_sign_800x450.jpg,"Clozapine — the only FDA-approved drug for treatment-resistant schizophrenia — can cause severe neutropenia, so is subject to a Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy (REMS). Panelists also voted overwhelmingly that it is not necessary to mandate physician education about clozapine’s risk of neutropenia and the need for ANC monitoring. “I have fantasized for years about abolishing the clozapine REMS,” said Jacob S. Ballon, MD, MPH, a temporary panel member and associate professor of psychiatry at Stanford University. “We estimate about 42,000 patients are not participating in the REMS, said James Shamp, VP of data intelligence and program analytics at United BioSource, a company that supports drug makers. Patients and families also described being rejected at pharmacies — most of which, despite the FDA’s supposed “enforcement discretion” continue to rigorously follow REMS requirements."

(AP) — At least three Michigan deer hunters have died of heart attacks during the current 16-day season, including two men who were trying to haul away the heavy animals, authorities said. “I’ve never seen three people die in 48 hours from heart attacks while deer hunting before,” said Dr. William Morrone, the medical examiner for Bay, Midland, Tuscola, Arenac and Iosco counties. They’re just a fraction of the thousands of people participating in the traditional firearm deer season, which began Nov. 15. “Better diets, more activity and everybody should think about a physical before this,” he said. “Because deer hunting is a big deal in this state, but it’s also taxing the body.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press."
Gene Repair Restores Brain Signal Efficiency in Autism - Neuroscience News,https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2024/11/autism-gene-therapy-myelin-neuroscience.jpg,"Summary: Autism-linked SHANK3 gene mutations disrupt not only neurons but also oligodendrocytes, essential for producing myelin, which insulates nerve fibers. Using gene therapy, researchers successfully repaired these cells in a mouse model, restoring their function and myelin production. They validated their findings with human-derived stem cells, confirming similar impairments and repair mechanisms. “Thus, damage to this gene can disrupt message transmission between neurons, impairing the brain’s development and function. “This means that the defective protein associated with autism disrupts message transmission to these vital support cells."

Rutledge said some symptoms and clues are ""very suggestive"" that you're experiencing a virus rather than seasonal allergies or vice versa. This might be especially important if you plan on being around a person who's older or otherwise at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19. Antiviral medications like Paxlovid may be prescribed for older adults and younger people who have a higher risk of getting severe illness from COVID-19. For example, antihistamines like Claritin or Zyrtec are standard allergy medications, but you could also find relief from a decongestant."
