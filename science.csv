"As NASA increasingly relies on commercial space, there are some troubling signs - Ars Technica",https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ltv-2022-closeup-final-1-1152x648.webp,"Some key commercial space leaders have left or been edged out of the agency, leaving questions about who will champion these programs. Afterward, NASA even calculated how much it would have cost the agency to develop comparable capabilities using its traditional contracting methods. Following this experience, Boeing, along with other traditional contractors, including Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, have essentially told NASA they will no longer bid for fixed-price contracts. NASA also appears to be funding a far lower share of costs than it did during the cargo and crew programs. And more recently, the longtime head of commercial space at NASA, Phil McAlister, was reassigned to a lesser office."
"Venting Doesn't Reduce Anger, But Something Else Does, Study Shows - ScienceAlert",https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/03/AngrySideFaceWearingSuit.jpg,"""Despite what popular wisdom may suggest, even going for a run is not an effective strategy because it increases arousal levels and ends up being counterproductive."" Research shows that can work, they say, but the review also sheds important light on an alternate pathway for defusing fury. Ball sports and other physical activities involving play seemed to reduce physiological arousal, suggesting exertion might be more useful for reducing anger if it's fun. ""Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they're definitely not the best way to reduce anger,"" said Bushman. ""It's really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression."""
Aurora forecast — Will the northern lights be visible tonight? - Space.com,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wFH2YmrQgDu9pmZB3MkVne-1200-80.jpg,"Likely launched from Region 3889 or 3897 on the Sun's farside, this #solarstorm doesn't appear to have any Earth-directed component. While the current weekend forecast doesn't look overly promising for dramatic auroras that can all change very quickly. Solar wind streams from coronal holes can interact with the planet's magnetosphere, potentially causing geomagnetic storms and creating stunning aurora displays.

NASA's Curiosity rover captures 360-degree view of Mars — and finds strange sulfur stones - Space.com,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/go72vbYBoxAzGhmUUGMUB9-1200-80.jpg,"The Mars rover, built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), has slowly scaled Mount Sharp since 2014. It's possible water flowed through it some eons ago, or that strong winds are responsible for the formation Or, perhaps landslides cascading down from Mount Sharp's higher elevations created Gediz Vallis, which could explain the boulders and debris Curiosity has found along its trip. After over a decade of hard travels, Curiosity remains functional, if somewhat beat up from the tough Mars surface. Now, the science team is forming a timeline of events, based on what Curiosity observed during its travels. NASA wants to be prepared just in case Space is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher."

Supermassive black holes bent the laws of physics to grow to monstrous sizes - Space.com,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NCc7MeWiHYmeSGQ4NhDPUn-1200-80.png,"Such feeding supermassive black holes cause the material that surrounds them (in flattened clouds called ""accretion disks"") to glow so brightly they are seen at vast distances. This team's findings suggest that the Eddington limit can be defined, and supermassive black holes could enter a phase of ""super-Eddington accretion.""

All of the Bharatiya Antariksha station’s modules are slated to be assembled in orbit by 2035, Space.com reports. India’s fledgling space program could have its first manned space mission next year, but the country’s enthusiasm for space exploration is at an all-time high after unexpectedly besting Russia in a race to land the first spacecraft on the Moon’s South Pole in August. India’s Chandrayaan-3 swooped into and stole all of the glory just days later. Spaceflight is inseparable from the Space Race and its legacy."
"NASA’s Chandra, Hubble Tune Into ‘Flame-Throwing’ Guitar Nebula - NASA",https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/guitar.jpg,"5 min read To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Normally found only in heavy metal bands or certain post-apocalyptic films, a “flame-throwing guitar” has now been spotted moving through space. Astronomers have captured movies of this extreme cosmic object using NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope. In this situation, the usual process of converting mass into energy, famously determined by Albert Einstein’s E = mc2 equation, is reversed. It also provides an example of how this process is injecting electrons and positrons into the interstellar medium. Learn more about the Chandra X-ray Observatory and its mission here: https://www.nasa.gov/chandra https://chandra.si.edu Visual Description: This release features two short videos and a labeled composite image, all featuring what can be described as a giant flame-throwing guitar floating in space."

This allowed astronomers to keep tabs on the star while it was out of view from Earth. STEREO’s observations revealed another unexpected dimming between June and August of 2020, when ground-based telescopes couldn’t view the star. Scientists aimed WISPR at Venus again on Nov. 6, 2024, during Parker’s seventh flyby, observing a different part of the planet than previous flybys. NASA supercomputers are shedding light on what causes some of the Sun’s most complex behaviors."
Did NASA's Perseverance rover find organics on Mars? These scientists aren't so sure - Space.com,https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o2XokSGuBqmgv3dnFVoT6-1200-80.jpg,"Last summer, NASA’s Perseverance rover made a groundbreaking discovery on Mars when it detected carbon-based molecules, known as organics, that many scientists believe could hint at the possible presence of ancient extraterrestrial life. ""SHERLOC's luminescence mode produces a very high signal per unit amount of certain organic molecules, but it is not especially diagnostic,"" said Farley. Perseverance was tasked with collecting and analyzing samples from Mars' Jezero Crater, chosen for its history as an ancient open-system lake approximately 3.5 billion years ago. Degeneracy often makes interpreting these results impossible, according to Scheller, and in less critical cases, many scientists would typically leave the data uninterpreted.

How the James Webb Telescope is Turning Modern Astronomy on Its Head - Next Big Idea Club Magazine,https://cdn.nextbigideaclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/19213942/panekfeatured-1.jpg,"His writing has appeared in the New York Times, Scientific American, Smithsonian, Natural History, and Outside, among other publications. As researchers adjust their expectations and predictions, our understanding of genesis in the cosmos is rapidly changing. Not until the 1990s did astronomers know for certain that some stars in our Milky Way galaxy do have planetary systems. Can supernovae produce dust at such a rate that they affect the evolution of entire galaxies? Webb can see farther than Hubble, but for astronomers, the question has been, how far?"
"Ancient human ancestor Lucy was not alone — she lived alongside at least 4 other proto-human species, emerging research suggests - Livescience.com",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dz8mESJ4STZwf4LLDApwNL-1200-80.jpg,"For almost a million years, A. afarensis lived throughout East Africa, and paleoanthropologists have found numerous fossils of this species ranging from north central Ethiopia to northern Tanzania — a span of 1,460 miles (2,350 kilometers), or roughly the distance from Boston to Miami. ""It was a highly successful species that was comfortable in lots of different habitats,"" Donald Johanson, a paleoanthropologist at Arizona State University who, along with his graduate student Tom Gray, discovered Lucy's fossils in 1974, told Live Science. Woranso-Mille also yielded a partial foot dated to between 3.4 million and 3.3 million years ago, and its opposable big toe suggests this individual was better adapted for climbing than A. afarensis, a species that habitually walked on two legs. Almost all primates are social creatures, living in groups and cooperating to forage for food. Her articles have also appeared in venues such as Forbes, Smithsonian, and Mental Floss."
