There’s a browser extension tool called Sky Follower Bridge that will help you find X users who’ve migrated to Bluesky. You can write posts or reply to others but keep it short because there’s a limit of 300 characters — 20 more than on X. But it’s also taking a different approach by open sourcing its content moderation system in an attempt to resolve problems with traditional moderation services which it says “lack transparency and user control.”  So, individuals or groups can set up their own content filters, or labelers, that go beyond what Bluesky offers."

DOJ: Google must sell Chrome to end monopoly - TechCrunch,"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-1337403704.jpg?resize=1200,800","Judge Mehta ruled in August that Google was an illegal monopoly for abusing its power over the search business. The DOJ hinted that if Google fails to put limitations on Android, it should be forced to sell it off.Prosecutors also argued that the company should be prohibited from entering into exclusionary third-party contracts with browser or phone companies, such as Google’s contract with Apple, which is to be the default search engine on all Apple products. It would break a range of Google products — even beyond Search — that people love and find helpful in their everyday lives,” president of global affairs and Google’s chief legal officer Kent Walker said in a blog post. He added that if the proposal goes through, it will hamper people’s ability to access Google Search.
